# Auction Platform

## Project Overview
The Auction Platform is a web application designed for users to create, manage, and participate in online auctions. The platform consists of a backend built with Node.js and a frontend created using a modern JavaScript framework. The entire application architecture is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment and scaling.

## Installation

To get started with the Auction Platform, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-directory
   ```

2. **Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.** You can download them from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

3. **Run Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command builds the necessary services and starts the application. The backend will be available on port `3000` and the frontend on port `5173`.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can access the frontend by navigating to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser. The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Create and manage auctions
- Real-time bidding
- User profiles and auction history
- Secure JWT-based authentication

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies in the backend, as defined in the `package.json` file (note that the actual dependencies should be checked in the respective backend `package.json`):

- Express.js
- Mongoose (for MongoDB interactions)
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- Other relevant packages...

- **backend/**: Contains the backend service code, models, routes, and controllers.
- **frontend/**: Contains the frontend service code and assets.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration file for Docker Compose, defining services, networks, and volumes.

## Notes

- Ensure to replace `your_strong_jwt_secret_here_32+chars` in the `docker-compose.yml` with a strong secret for JWT authentication.
- Modify the MongoDB credentials (`MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`) in the `docker-compose.yml` as necessary for your environment.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the backend section or comment your code effectively for further implementations.
